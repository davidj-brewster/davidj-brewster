## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Professional Background
Principal DevOps Engineer working to connect the world of science at ResearchGate in Berlin. I have expertise in backend softwae and database development, cloud transformation, infrastructure performance and cost optimization, and platform engineering/SRE/DevOps. My work typically combines hands-on development with strategic leadership across cloud environments (GCP, AWS) and on-premises infrastructure.

Beyond DevOps, most of my GitHub projects are the results of independent research in Medical AI and neuroimaging over the last few months, focusing on:
- Brain MRI processing, segmentation, and anomaly detection
- Custom 2D/3D deep learning models for medical imaging
- Integration of open-source neuroimaging tools
I'm also researching self-correcting LLMs and AI-driven reasoning frameworks.

## Technical Skills
- **Languages**: Python, SQL, Shell/Bash, HCL (Terraform)
- **Cloud**: GCP
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu, MacOS
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Helm, Docker, Terraform, Puppet, ArgoCD
- **ML/AI**: PyTorch, scikit-learn, pillow, image processing libraries
- **Medical Imaging**: DICOM, NiFTI, FreeSurfer, FSL, ANTs, c3d

## Background
With degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science, I combine theoretical foundations with practical experience. I enjoy diving into complex problems at the intersection of engineering, AI, and problem-solving and found quite a lot of passion recently in medical AI.
