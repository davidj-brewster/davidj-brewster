## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Professional Background
Principal DevOps Engineer working to connect the world of science at ResearchGate in Berlin. I have expertise in backend softwae and database development, cloud transformation, infrastructure performance and cost optimization, and platform engineering/SRE/DevOps. My work typically combines hands-on development with strategic leadership across cloud (mostly GCP) and on-premises installs.

Beyond DevOps, most of my GitHub projects are the results of independent research in Medical AI and neuroimaging over the last few months, focusing on:
- Brain MRI processing, segmentation, and anomaly detection
- Custom 2D/3D deep learning models for medical imaging
- Integration of open-source neuroimaging tools
I'm also researching self-correcting LLMs and AI-driven reasoning frameworks.
