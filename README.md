## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Professional Background
I'm a Principal DevOps Engineer working to connect the world of science at ResearchGate in Berlin. I have expertise in backend software and database development, cloud transformation, infrastructure performance, and automation. 

Beyond DevOps, most of my GitHub projects are the results of independent research in Medical AI and neuroimaging over the last few months, focusing on:
- Brain MRI processing, segmentation, and anomaly detection
- Custom 2D/3D deep learning models for medical imaging
- Integration of open-source neuroimaging tools
  
I'm also researching self-correcting & adaptively meta-prompting (pairs of) LLMs with AI-driven reasoning frameworks which I think will supercede pure model strength in a very short period of time - and generating "arbiter" meta-prompts to evaluate model performance objectively.

## Featured Projects

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- **[terraform-gke-scripts](https://github.com/davidj-brewster/terraform-gke-scripts)** - Terraform scripts for GCP/GKE orchestration automation
- **[temporalio-video-splitter](https://github.com/davidj-brewster/temporalio-video-splitter)** - Example project using Temporal.io for workflow orchestration

### AI & Automation
- **[multi-llm-chat](https://github.com/davidj-brewster/multi-llm-chat)** - Self-adaptive AI Meta-Prompting and AI-to-AI chats, including multimodal and AI "personas". The results are occasionally..hilarious!
